04 Conclusion


1.1 Introduction
- Driverless cars are getting closer to reality and at a faster pace than ever. But it is still a bit far fetched dream to have one in your garage. For the time being, there are still a lot of combustion and hybrid cars that roar around the road, for some it chills. Though the overall data on sales of automobiles shows a huge drop in sales in the last couple of years, cars are still a big attraction for many. Cars are more than just a utility for many. They are often the pride and status of the family. We all have different tastes when it comes to owning a car or at least when thinking of owning one.

1.2 Libraries Used
- Numpy (for Numerical Analysis)
- Pandas (for handling data files)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations inline & figure settings)
- Seaborn (for better relational visualizations)
- Scikit Learn (for model building & data pre-processing)

1.3 Algorithm
- Random Forest Regression

1.4 Data Set
- The DataSet is downloaded from Kaggle.

2.1 Problem Statement
- AIM: To predict the price of used cars based on the previous data obtained from scraping several sources

2.2 Business Understanding
- Companies can restrict the selling price of the used car being posted by the customer in their respective websites.
- Companies can provide a visualization to customers for a better understanding of their car selling price.
- Companies can have Fraud Customers who are posting cars for higher prices.
- Companies can expand their network based on the number of cars being sold the next year by prediction.
